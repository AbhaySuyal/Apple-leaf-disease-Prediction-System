        Welcome to the Apple Plant Leaf Disease Recognition System! üåøüîç
        
        Our mission is to help in identifying plant diseases efficiently. Upload an image of a plant, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of diseases. Together, let's protect our crops and ensure a healthier harvest!
        
        ### How It Works
        1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases.
        2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
        3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.
        
        ### Why Choose Us?
        - **Accuracy:** Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate disease detection.
        - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
        - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.
        
        ### Get Started
        Click on the **Disease Recognition** page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Plant Disease Recognition System!
        
        ### About Us
